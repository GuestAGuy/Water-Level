# Water-Level Project

# Abstract
Our project will be taking collected water reservoir data in California to create a regression to predict future water levels. It will highlight the differing various changes of a Lake Berryessa by their reservoir storage, inflow and outflow. A reliable prediction model will help aid in better planning and mitigations of risks such as droughts. The data in observation will be taken from 2001 to 2021.
